## [MyVision: Customizability meets abstraction](https://github.com/Abhiswain97/MyVision){:target="_blank"}

This is my Computer Vision toolkit. It's a wrapper over PyTorch combining things I like from different libraries like *fastai*, *keras* etc.

## [Leaf disease detection using image segmentation](https://github.com/Abhiswain97/Leaf_disease_detection){:target="_blank"}

This is my final year project about detecting plant leaf disease and segmenting the diseased part. However, there's a catch in my project, I have done it without the use of any cnn for segmentation. Instead, it uses a cascade of classifiers to do the detection and segmentation.

## [CheXNet: Radiologist-Level Pneumonia Detection using deep learning](https://github.com/Abhiswain97/CheXNet){:target="_blank"}

This project is an implementation of the paper I worked on. CheXNet detects 14 different pathologies from chest X-rays. It uses a Densenet-121 for detection.
