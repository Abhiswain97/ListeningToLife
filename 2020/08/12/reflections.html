Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜ƒ

Today I just wanna reflect on 4 years of my B.tech life. Not just that but also about some other things. It's gonna be a long one but I just want to write it out here. Lately, I have found writing what I feel to be therapeutic and maybe it will also help me clear my head out. So, here we go.

2016 was a hard year for me. Nothing seemed to go well. I screwed up all my entrance exams, I could see the disappointment in the eyes of parents. I absolutely had no idea where to go or what to do. I was sad and I was fine with anything they would ask me to do. I joined NIST, which is one of the local engineering college here in Brahmapur. I did not know what to expect. It was very tough for me to comprehend anything, this continuous voice in my head "Oh you just screwed it up all" kept on going. It was only when my college began was able I to focus on other things. It was the 8th August, 2016 almost exactly 4 years ago. As my first semester classes began, things started getting hectic. We would spend like 12 hrs in college. I would leave by morning 8:30 bus and return home by 7:15 bus in the evening. I became so busy that I could not think of anything. The voice in my head was slowly subsiding. In my first sem I was so hell bent on proving that I could get good marks and stuff that I worked pretty hard. My first sem results came in and I had scored 8.89 sgpa very close to my aim of scoring a 9. My parents brightened up. For the first time in 2 years I saw that I have got so many opportunities lined up for me. Then it dawned on me that it was never about marks, I had to prove a point to myself that I can push through the noise, believe that I can do whatever I wanted to and see that a whole life is up there to live. 

That was the last time I cared about my sgpa. Don't get me wrong but I had always been told that if you acheive a 9-pointer in college, you've hit the peak. But as far as I could see, I was far away from what was actaully necessary not just in the industry but also to solve problems in general. I was promised happiness, but I could see there were people who made apps, websites and other stuffs which I barely had an idea. That was one of the very first lessons I learnt in my college life. *Higher marks do not correlate to higher skills.* Infact, your marks only serve as a criterion for eligibility. That's all they are for. Now I am not saying that you should fail your exams, but always remember that they give u eligibility but nothing more than that. Infact slowly the recruitment scenario is moving to skill based, so all these won't matter about. This is something I am very happy about.  -->
