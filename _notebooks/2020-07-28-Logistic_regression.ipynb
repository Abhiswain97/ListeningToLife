    "Hey! This post is about my introduction to the world of Julia. I took this challenge of learning Julia and making something in it. Since Julia is pretty similar to Python, I made a hypothesis. That is can I learn julia and be up and running with something in two days? What I realised is, if you're from a python background and have some expereince in it, then learning Julia is going to be fun and breezy for you. So, here I am after my two day rendezvous with Julia.\n",

    "So, what I used to learn Julia?\n",
    "I used resources from [julia academy](https://juliaacademy.com/)\n",

    "I decided to go for one the resources I learnt deep learning from: [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome)\n",

    "- Impemented the Julia version of [Week 2 assignment](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/notebook/zAgPl/logistic-regression-with-a-neural-network-mindset) of [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome) course.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's not exactly that actually, I have applied the concepts to banknote authentication.\n",
    "- Data is from UCI machine learning repository\n",
