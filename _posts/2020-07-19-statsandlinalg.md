title: Statistics and Linear Algebra for ML/DL
---

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜ƒ

Today, I am gonna talk about something I have been meaning to do for the longest amout of time. I am now many months into my ML journey, so I have now quite a bit of experience. So, I have a basic understanding of the ML/DL algos but it always feels like I lack in explaining why something works over the others. This is where the mathematical part comes in. Having a sound understanding of the statistical methods is necessary when the explainability comes in. Inorder to do that I have decided to start a <ins>*Probability & Statistics*</ins> and <ins>*Linear Algebra*</ins> series. This wy I would not only be able to learn both but also share with the community which gave me so much. Also, it's a part of the *"Feynmann technique"* which I am so fond of.

# Probability & Statistics

## Books: 
- [*Business statistics for contemporary decision making*](https://www.amazon.in/Business-Statistics-Contemporary-Decision-Making/dp/8126521546/ref=pd_sbs_14_2/257-8608761-1170154?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=8126521546&pd_rd_r=b4f7e949-0d73-4549-b120-e86fb1f606e6&pd_rd_w=VJgyd&pd_rd_wg=doo7E&pf_rd_p=00b53f5d-d1f8-4708-89df-2987ccce05ce&pf_rd_r=RQEDQA024GQ7HPVACRYS&psc=1&refRID=RQEDQA024GQ7HPVACRYS)
- [*Mathematical Statistics with applications*](https://www.amazon.in/Mathematical-Statistics-Applications-Dennis-Wackerly/dp/0495110817/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=mathematical+statistics+with+applications+wackerly&qid=1595177027&s=books&sr=1-2)

# Linear Algebra

## Books:
- [*Introduction to Linear Algebra (Gilbert Strang)*](https://www.amazon.in/Introduction-Linear-Algebra-Gilbert-Strang/dp/0980232775/ref=sr_1_5?crid=O4QLD0HT1F7A&dchild=1&keywords=gilbert+strang+linear+algebra&qid=1595177337&s=books&sprefix=gilbert+s%2Cstripbooks%2C426&sr=1-5)

# Applied resources
- My favorite: [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R*](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)
- [*Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50+ Essential Concepts Using R and Python*](https://www.amazon.in/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/9352135652)
- [*Introduction to Linear Algebra for Applied Machine Learning with Python*](https://pabloinsente.github.io/intro-linear-algebra)

As I read the material and understand a concept I will write an article about it. It will be two parellel series one for each. If you want to follow it then all of it will be posted on my [**Medium**](https://medium.com/@abhi08as.as). I will see you there!

As always, thank you for reading ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ƒ!
