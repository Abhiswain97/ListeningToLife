title: questus ordo in rebus
---

This is my first post here and I wanted it to be something I have wanted to do for the longest time. *questus ordo in rebus* is latin for getting things in order. I was very naive to think that it was pretty simple to do and maybe it is for many people but guess I belong to the latter category where you gotta struggle to do it. Well the bottom line is, I want to get things in order. It's not like I have not tried to do it before but there was just so much happening around me, I mean from classes, seminar, minor project to placements, major presentation etc that I couldn't pause to think about where I am in life and what I want to do moving forward. So, this lockdown period for me was like brakes applied to a car moving at a great speed, it's kind of pretty sudden and shakes you up but if you think about it maybe it was required?. I think that was the worst analogy I could come up with, but I really am not very good with words. Basically, this lockdown got me pausing and thinking. I wont lie, it was rather frustrating in the beginning because I was used to go walking, running & stuff I did because I wanted to be a "fit ðŸ’ª guy" but now that it has been quite sometime I feel it has done me a lot of good. Like I said maybe the brakes were required?. So, let's begin !

I feel like things I have learnt I know them pretty well but they seem to be in scatters. Well, not anymore, that ends today. Something which I love to do is read & read a lot. My school notebooks had this thing writetn on the back cover: 
> "Reading maketh a full man."

I used to think it was someone in my school who wrote it, but it actually is a quote by *Francis Bacon*. It resonates with me alot. Reading actually fills your mind with a variety, so the next time you think about anything you look at it from a lot perspectives. And that is where we are going to start today. I have a lot of machine learning, deep learning, statistics, data science books, now this is very cool actually but it also is very overwhelming. Like I get really confused as to where to start. I want to read everything and I try to do it all at once and I end up not reading anything. After screwing up numerous times I have a plan of what I want to do. I have decided I will read one applied book along with a more theoretical book. 

The options:
- Applied machine learning & deep learning:
    - [Approaching almost any machine learning problem](https://www.amazon.in/Approaching-Almost-Machine-Learning-Problem-ebook/dp/B089P13QHT/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2LES4AWAVBS0K&dchild=1&keywords=approaching+almost+any+machine+learning+problem&qid=1594338603&s=books&sprefix=approach%2Cstripbooks%2C339&sr=1-1)
    - [Hands-on machine learning with scikit-learn & tensorflow](https://www.amazon.in/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-Tensor/dp/9352139054?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&psc=1)
    - [Python machine learning by sebestian raschka](https://www.amazon.in/Python-Machine-Learning-scikit-learn-TensorFlow-ebook/dp/B07VBLX2W7/ref=sr_1_3?crid=PGEKJB22PT0P&dchild=1&keywords=python+machine+learning+sebastian+raschka&qid=1594338641&s=books&sprefix=python+machine+%2Cstripbooks%2C357&sr=1-3)
    - [Programming collective intelligence](https://www.amazon.in/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications-ebook/dp/B00F8QDZWG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=7CSA6SJS295A&dchild=1&keywords=programming+collective+intelligence&qid=1594338686&s=books&sprefix=programming+collec%2Cstripbooks%2C353&sr=1-1)

- Theoretical books:
    - [PRML](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf)
    - [BRML](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/textbook/090310.pdf)
    - [ESLR](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/#:~:text=Elements%20of%20Statistical%20Learning%3A%20data%20mining%2C%20inference%2C%20and%20prediction.)
    - [ISLR(has code examples in R)](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)
    - Professor Michael I. Jordan's [reading list](https://honglangwang.wordpress.com/2014/12/30/machine-learning-books-suggested-by-michael-i-jordan-from-berkeley/)
    - & list continues..............

So, what are my choices?

After a lot of research I have decided to go for Hands-on ML & for theory I chose ESLR. I will give my best to it and try and keep posting here about my progress.

Wait a minute! Aren't we missing something? The younger me would have stopped right here but, I now am a little sensible and I realise no amount of book reading will do me any good if I don't code and build things up. Enter **Kaggle**. Besides reading stuff I will try and spend my time implementing things in kaggle! Let's see how it goes! See ya.

PS: I have another dream of building a deep learning library using rust, I really wanna learn about it. That's for another post !

Thank you for reading !
