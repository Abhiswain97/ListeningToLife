title: Importance of a proper posture 
---

Today I want to talk about something I had a really bad time with. You must have already guessed from the title, I am going to talk to you about why it's important to maintain a good posture while doing whatever is that you do, but I will talk to you mostly from programmer point of view.

If you are like me who loves to learn stuff on your own all the time, especailly things like coding, & mostly CS related stuff you must be spending a lot of time infront of you laptop or PC. Now and then I have seen I struggle a lot with a lot of neck pain. So, finally I decided to do a little bit of research. I found out that if my laptop was on level with my eyes or a little above, then I could easily sit for a long time. On the other hand if it was below my eye level and I tried to hunch over and do stuff 7 out of 10 times I would have a stiff neck. And as I am writing this, I do have stiffness in my neck. It's very painful. And I don't want anyone else to suffer from this. So, let me tell you what I have been doing, it's not much but I hope it will be of some use:

1. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NOsE-VPpkE) amazing video by a physiotherapist. It did me a world of good especially the last exercise. 

2. Apply pain relieving spray or apply balm, I applied [omnigel](https://www.flipkart.com/cipla-omni-gel-spray/p/itmebzh8xmhqhycv) 

There are also really good articles explaining why it happens and how you can remedy it. Like this one: [Neck Pain: Possible Causes and How to Treat It](https://www.healthline.com/health/neck-pain) & [The Importance of Posture](https://www.barringtonortho.com/blog/the-importance-of-posture).

I would also like to tell you what one of my favorite school principals sister Innocentia told me, "Never take a chance with your health, if you're healthy then things can be done at a later time. But if you cripple yourself today maybe you won't be able to do it ever again".

Thank you for reading !
